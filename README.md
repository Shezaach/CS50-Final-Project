## Functionality
When the game is first loaded up, the user sees two buttons: one for the Magic Square game and one for the Color Memory game.

### Magic Square:
The Magic Square game may seem easy at first, but it is very interesting and involving. In order to solve the puzzle, the user must enter a number in each of the nine boxes so that they add up to 15 in each row and column. When the check button is clicked, first each input will be checked to make sure it is valid and then the values will be calculated. If all of the values do not equal 15, the labels will turn red and an incorrect message will turn up. The user is now given an option to try again. 

### Color Memory:
The Color Memory game is exactly what it sounds like - a puzzle in which you must remember the colors. A series of four colors - red, blue, green, and yellow - will flash across the users' screen in a random order. The user must remember the order and repeat it by pressing the corresponding buttons when prompted. If the sequence provided by the user matches the initial random one, then the user has successfully completed the puzzle. However, the user can play again as many times as they would like.
